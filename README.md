# DaGiveBloods
Da Give Bloods is a chatbot system that helps recruit blood donors for hospitals, blood banks, and blood donation centers. The platform allows health workers to submit requests for blood donations and for blood donors to receive those requests via direct messages on a variety of social media and SMS platforms. Da Give Bloods helps solve the blood shortage by helping health workers connect with and maintain a consistent and diverse group of blood donors, which ensures that there is a consistent supply of blood for patients in need of transfusions. The need for blood is global and present especially in rural communities and developing countries. According to the research, of the 180 countries analyzed, 107 had insufficient blood to meet their needs (Roberts et al., 2019).
